# Module 10 Challenge
In this assignment we explore climate data including temperature and precipitation, conduct analysis on that data and then use flask to create an app to showcase it. In the main folder there is a climate_starter jupyter notebook file, along with an app.py Climate App, along with CSV and sqlite files needed to run in the resource folder.

To run the <start> and <start/end> sections of the app, please enter dates in YYYY/MM/DD format in the URL.

Module was completed working with study group partners Muneeb Samad, Sultan Raheem and Lucas Perez.
